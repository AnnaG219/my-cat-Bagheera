      <h2>Bagheera</h2>
      <h4>Why is <em>he</em> my favourite?</h4>
      <p>Well there's an endless amount of reasons</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Well of course that adorable face</li>
        <li>I'm pretty sure he thinks he's a human...no, I'm sure of that</li>
        <li>He's beyond energetic, playful, and loving</li>
      </ul>
      <p> But honestly, this critter has gotten me through some difficult times, and never ceases to put a smile on my face. And he also has some: <em>unique</em> attritbutes I think you should know about</p>
      <ol>
        <li>His tail is almost <strong>2 feet</strong> long!</li>
        <li>Not surprisingly, when i first adopted him his name was <em>Sir Lanclot Longtail</em></li>
        <li>Aside from his long tall, he is also freakishly big for a cat and we suspect is part feral cal.</li>
        <li>Because of his size, and markings, he earned his name from the panther in <strong>The Jungle Book</strong> Bagheera</li>
      </ol>
